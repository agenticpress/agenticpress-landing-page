## WordPress Website Design FAQ

What’s included in your WordPress website design packages?

Our WordPress website design packages include a professionally designed responsive website, optimization for AI search (AISO), secure hosting with SSL certification, daily backups, regular updates, and malware protection. Each package is customizable with additional pages, widgets, SEO services, blogging content, e-commerce functionality, and AI chatbots based on your business needs.

How long does it take to design and develop a WordPress website?

The typical WordPress website design process takes approximately 3-4 weeks from initial consultation to launch. This includes discovery and planning (3 days), plan approval (3 days), asset collection (5 days), design and development (5 days), review and revisions (6 days), SEO/AISO implementation (3 days), and website launch (1 day). More complex websites with custom features may require additional time.

Do I own my WordPress website after it’s built?

Yes, you fully own your WordPress website. We design and develop using the WordPress platform, which gives you complete ownership. You can access the WordPress dashboard to make updates, and if you ever decide to move to different hosting, you can export the entire website. Our approach ensures you’re never locked into our services.

How is your WordPress design process different from other agencies?

Our WordPress design process stands out by integrating AI Search Optimization (AISO) from the ground up. While most agencies focus solely on traditional SEO, our process includes schema markup, semantic HTML, strategic content creation, and optimized entity mapping—all essential for visibility in both traditional and AI-powered search engines. We also offer a streamlined, transparent process with clear milestones and fixed pricing.

Can you customize my WordPress theme to match my brand identity?

Absolutely. Our WordPress design services include complete customization of your website’s appearance to match your brand identity. We incorporate your logo, color scheme, typography, and overall brand aesthetics to create a cohesive online presence. Our designers work with premium WordPress themes that offer extensive customization options, ensuring your website stands out while maintaining optimal performance.

What ongoing support do you provide after my WordPress website launches?

After your WordPress website launches, we provide comprehensive ongoing support including secure hosting, daily backups, regular WordPress core and plugin updates, and malware protection. Our monthly support package includes one hour of minor content updates and edits, plus ongoing AISO maintenance to ensure your site remains optimized for AI search engines. Additional development work or more extensive changes are available at transparent rates.

Do your WordPress websites work well on mobile devices?

Yes, all our WordPress websites are built with responsive design principles, ensuring they perform beautifully on all devices—smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. Mobile optimization is a core part of our design process, not an afterthought. We test extensively on various devices and screen sizes to ensure fast loading times, proper element scaling, and intuitive navigation regardless of how visitors access your site.

Can you integrate e-commerce functionality into my WordPress website?

Yes, we can integrate full e-commerce functionality into your WordPress website using WooCommerce or other e-commerce plugins. Our e-commerce WordPress implementations include product catalog setup, secure payment gateway integration, inventory management systems, tax and shipping configuration, and checkout process optimization. All e-commerce features are built with both traditional SEO and AI search optimization in mind.

What’s the difference between WordPress.com and the WordPress websites you build?

We build websites using WordPress.org (often called self-hosted WordPress), which offers complete flexibility and ownership compared to WordPress.com. With our WordPress websites, you have full access to customize code, install any plugins or themes, monetize however you choose, and own your data completely. WordPress.com has limitations on customization, plugin usage, and monetization options, particularly on their lower-tier plans.

How do you ensure my WordPress website is secure from hackers and malware?

We implement multiple layers of security for every WordPress website we design. This includes secure hosting environments, SSL certificates, regular malware scanning, WordPress core and plugin updates, login protection measures, firewall implementation, and daily backups. Our ongoing maintenance ensures your site remains protected against emerging threats, and in the unlikely event of a security incident, we can quickly restore your site from clean backups.
